1. Create deck
2. Shuffle
3. Deal (even amount to each "player")
4. Three bots one player
5. Explain the rules
6. Option to call bullshit
7. Says peanutbutter after lie
8. If bots do not contain a card they can play -> play card at random
9. Pick up deck if you were wrong or properly called out
10. Always displays players hand at the start of their turn
11. Asks how many cards player would like to use
12. asks for index of each card want to play until match number of cards declared
13. Muse play minimum of 1 card and maximum of 4

15. How will bots call bullshit(?) 
        - maybe scan deck and compare number of said cards in hand vs number of cards of that ranking played
            - bots keep track of the cards they played, if deck is picked up it resets
